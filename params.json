The repository will over time contain different implementations of agents in games which I (and hopefully others) am working on. \r\n\r\nUnity Demos\r\n===========\r\n\r\n* [POSH Stealth](http://swen.fairrats.eu/concrete5/index.php?cID=152) \r\n  * The first folder in the repo is a Unity stealth game demo based on Unity's own Stealth demo but augmented with the POSH# action selection mechanism and the ERGo model---a nature inspired mechanism for behaviour arbitration. The project is build using Unity 4.6beta due to their inclusion of the new UI system which looks super promising. The whole project except GUI works however fine under Unity 4.3+.\r\n  * [direct source link](https://github.com/suegy/POSHSharpGames/tree/master/ergo-stealth-unity)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project as it currently is is maintained by Swen Gaudl (@suegy) as part of his PhD on advancing artificial agent design. The project started in 2014 to track certain demo code which was presented at the AIGameDev Conference and the Computational Intelligence in Games Conference.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf the demos are not working or you want to contribute to any of the contained demos feel free to get in touch with Swen (@suegy). If you want to know more about the underlying concepts behind some of the code have a look here, [Swen's Research Stuff](http://swen.fairrats.eu/concrete5/research/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
