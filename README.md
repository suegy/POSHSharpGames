POSHSharpGames
==============

this is a research repo containing snippets of projects using [POSH#](https://code.google.com/p/posh-sharp/). The rerpository will over time contain different implementations of agents in games which I (and hopefully others) am working on. 

Unity Demos
===========

* [POSH Stealth](http://swen.fairrats.eu/concrete5/index.php?cID=152) 
  * THe first folder in the repo is a Unity stealth game demo based on Unity's own Stealth demo but augmented with the POSH# action selection mechanism and the ERGo model---a nature inspired mechanism for behaviour arbitration. THe project is build using Unity 4.6beta due to their inclusion of the new UI system which looks super promissing. The whole project except GUI works however fine under Unity 4.3+.
